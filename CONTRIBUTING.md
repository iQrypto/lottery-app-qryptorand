# Contributing to the project

ðŸš§ This project is currently not open to external contributions.

We are actively developing the core architecture internally, and will open the repository for community contributions once the project stabilizes.

Until then, youâ€™re welcome to use, clone, and fork the project.

We appreciate your interest â€” stay tuned!
