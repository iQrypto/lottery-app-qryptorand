        <h1>About Queno</h1>
        <p><strong>QryptoRand</strong> is a blockchain-powered lottery game built by <strong>iQrypto</strong>. It combines the thrill of chance with the transparency of decentralized technologies, and uses certified quantum random number generation for provable fairness.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Players can choose up to 4 numbers from a grid of 32. When a bet is placed, 4 winning numbers are drawn using our quantum RNG. The more matches you get, the bigger your reward. For 1 match, you receive a small reward. With 2 matches, the reward increases significantly. Achieving 3 matches brings a high payout, while 4 matches earns you the ultimate JACKPOT.</p>

        <p>Each match multiplies your bet amount based on predefined reward tiers. You can bet using <strong>ETH</strong> or <strong>iQrypto</strong> tokens.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <p>QryptoRand uses quantum randomness via a certified RNG provider to ensure fairness. It supports bets in ETH and iQrypto, displays real-time results and reward calculations, and maintains a clear betting history for transparency. The auto-pick mode allows for quick, convenient play.</p>
